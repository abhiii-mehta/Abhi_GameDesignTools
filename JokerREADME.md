## **Save System (Not Implemented)**



\## Overview



This submission does **not** include a custom save system implementation.



\## Why Not?



Due to time constraints and overlapping deadlines, I was unable to create or polish a save system in time for submission.



\## Future Plan



In future versions of this toolbox, I intend to implement a JSON-based save system using Unity’s `PlayerPrefs` or local file storage via `System.IO`.



This system will likely:

\- Save player progress, unlocked levels, and settings

\- Be modular and reusable across projects

\- Include a SaveManager script and simple save/load buttons

## **In-Game Console (Not Implemented)**



\## Overview



This toolbox currently does **not** include an in-game console feature.



\## Reason



While the feature is useful for debugging, it was not a priority in my current projects. Due to limited time, I could not implement a clean version for inclusion.



\## Future Plan



If added later, my in-game console would:

\- Be toggled via a keypress (e.g., `~`)

\- Display debug logs (`Debug.Log`)

\- Optionally accept developer commands
